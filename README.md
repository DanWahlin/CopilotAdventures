Welcome to the Copilot Challenge! This challenge is all about learning new concepts and languages by using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) to help you write code.

To get started, ensure that you have both the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extensions installed and are signed in to GitHub in VS Code. We have a GitHub Codespace setup to help you get started quickly.

## Next Steps: Learn a New Language or Create a UI for Your Challenge

Once you've completed your first challenge, try it again but this time use GitHub Copilot to complete the challenge using a language that's new to you. For example, if you normally write code in C#, use Copilot to help you solve the challenge using Python or another language you'd like to learn more about.

Try creating a UI for your challenge. Use pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a library/framework of your choosing. Let GitHub Copilot/Chat help you out with the UI code. If your UI requires images, consider using [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/create) or another AI image generation service.

## Submit Your Own Copilot Challenge

Do you have a copilot challenge story/puzzle you'd like to submit for others to go through? We'd love to see it! Please submit a pull request to this repository with your challenge and solution. 

- Add `New Copilot Challenge: [Your Challenge Name]` into the PR title. Replace `[Your Challenge Name]` with the name of your challenge.
- Include if your challenge is at the beginner, intermediate, or advanced level.
- Follow the markdown template used with each challenge in the [Challenges](./Challenges) folder as you create your challenge.
- Provide an image for your challenge (use [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/create) or another image generator solution).
- Provide a solution using your chosen language. Place all of the code in a single file (to keep things simple) and include it in the PR.

We'll review your submission and merge it into the repo if it meets the criteria.
